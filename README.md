## 🛠️ What’s Inside

### 1. ISO Verification – Linux Mint 21.1 Cinnamon  
- Verifies download integrity via **SHA256 checksum** and **GPG signature**  
- Ensures authenticity before installation  

### 2. VirtualBox VM Setup – Linux Mint  
- Step-by-step guide to install Linux Mint 21.1 as a VM  
- Covers both **manual** and **unattended** installation options  

### 3. Essential Package Installation  
- Installs key tools: `nginx`, `MySQL`, `net-tools`, etc.  
- Prepares VM as a lightweight server and diagnostic environment  

### 4. VM-to-VM Networking & `/etc/hosts` Setup  
- Guides hostname mapping and IP configuration between Linux Mint and Kali VMs  
- Verifies connectivity with `ping` commands
